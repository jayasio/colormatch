A color matching game built over the weekends\*. Aims to familiarise players with the RGB color model.

Check it out at [colormatch.jayas.me](https://colormatch.jayas.me)

## Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Web framework with fine-grained reactivity (runes)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
- [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) - Declarative wrapper over Three.js for Svelte
- [Runed](https://runed.dev/) - Used the Finite State Machine for game flow

\* This project started as a weekend experiment with Threlte, a declarative API over Three.js.
The 3D cube started as a quick prototype to explain someone the RGB color model.
After a few more weekends, it evolved into a polished mini-game that helps players understand the RGB notation with a score/strike game mechanism.
