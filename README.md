### Features

- [ ] When game ends, user can review the questions
- [ ] Helpful feedback when wrong color is selected
- [ ] CMYK mode: use CMYK coordinates
  - more research required on color theory
  - Check out `device-cmyk()`
- [ ] Tutorial: Introduction for new users
- [ ] Tutorial: Visualise how to see RGB
- [ ] Tutorial: Show color on hover, maybe using `<HTML>` from `@threlte/extras`
- [ ] Shortcut: key help `âŒ˜ ?`
- [ ] Shortcut: background color

### Experience

- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Better User Interface
- [ ] Since game is based on colors, plus we now have luminance based colors, menu can be a random color everytime (? will it look good on top of blurred scene)
- [ ] Add hover feedback in scene
- [ ] Add select success / failure feedback in scene
- [ ] Audio effects (howler)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Added mechanism to highlight on dblclick, commented for now
- [ ] Transitions and microinteractions
- [ ] Better difficulty input
  - ðŸŸ¢ Transition for difficulty input
  - Visual representation
- [ ] Better question generator
  - Controlled randomness
  - Ignore immediate repeats
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Transition scene to blur background on menu

### Code hygiene

- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Consistent design system
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Better types
- [ ] Alpha based color variants
- [ ] Extract `state` to its own store
- [ ] Extract `color` logic to its own utility
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Add Open Graph attributes
- [ ] Camera jumps when transitioning: use a moving camera instead of `OrbitControls`, would also help in maybe implementing key-based scene manipulation
- [ ] Better components
- [ ] Upgrade to Svelte 5
- [~] Use slots for `Menu` end state
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Remove `Button` to its own component
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Remove duplication of `Difficulty` enum
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Standardise toast
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Restructure `game.ts`

### Bugs

- [ ] Sometimes after a rotate, click randomly stops working until mouse is moved; suspicious on damping on `OrbitControls`
- [ ] Clicking on `Slider` causes random jumps in scene sometimes
- [ ] Dynamic text color based on bg in `QuestionCard`
- [ ] Change `Play again` to `Play` when difficulty is changed
- [ ] Reset scene pan on `esc`
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ `.ignore-pointer` for allowing pointer passthrough in layout divs
  - ~~Use css `pointer-events: none` to allow pointer passthrough in layout divs~~
  - ~~DOM elements should be minimal to avoid obstruction of pointer on scene~~
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ iOS fix - single click is select; clicks with delta > 0 are ignored
- [x] ðŸŸ¢ Color space issues (NoToneMapping improved color fidelity significantly)
